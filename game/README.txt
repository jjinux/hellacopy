 * All the code was written by Adam and JJ, with the exception of the PGU
   library, of course.
 * Adam did most of the artwork from scratch.
 * The splash screen has a helicopter from http://www.fg-a.com/stgifs9a.htm.
 * The "you win" screen has a helicopter from
   http://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/1248748761/.
 * I got the sounds from http://www.atomsplitteraudio.com/info.php?id=25.

DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python: http://www.python.org/
  PyGame: http://www.pygame.org/

RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py

In version 1.2 I added sound.  If this doesn't work for you, please try version
1.1.  Thanks!

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

 * Hit enter to get started.
 * Use the arrow keys to move the helicopter.
 * Hold down the space bar to shoot.

 * Escape quits the game.
 * F9 toggles semi-full-screen mode.
 * Enter pauses the game.

There is only one level, so do your best!

Note, on MacBooks running Linux, things seem to break if you hold the spacebar
down.
